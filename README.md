# Traffic Light

Code for an over-engineered jenkins traffic light at Mendeley.

The traffic light is just a series of 74HC595 shift registers daisy-chained. There are four shift registers per light and two lights.

This code is for an Arduino, connections are made according to the wiring diagram, arduino-wiring-diagram.gif. The wire colours are consistent with the diagram.
The diagram is taken from the Arduino ShiftOut tutorial page: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ShiftOut
